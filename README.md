# Juraland

Welcome to the Juraland test challenge!

The purpose of this challenge is to as accurately as possible evaluate your proficiency as a front end web developer, using React. We recommend that you read this README very carefully before getting started.

This repository contains this README, an issue you have been assigned to resolve, and a wiki with documentation. Your job is to resolve the issue and push your code to the repository. We will then make an assessment by reviewing your code.

Of course we don't want to waste anyone's time, so we have worked really hard to keep the scope down and make the challenge interesting and fun. Even if the domain of this challenge is unrealistic (as you will learn when reading the background story), we have included problems that appear in a lot of real-world domains.

As a rule of thumb, it is possible to complete this challenge in five hours and receive a full score in our assessment.

Good luck and have fun!

## Requirements

To finish this challenge, you are required to implement the specification in the issue you have been assigned to resolve, using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. Besides that, here are a few other requirements you should keep in mind:

* The end result should be a [single-page web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), that should be able to be run in a modern desktop browser.
* You are free to use any libraries and frameworks you want. However, you are not allowed to use languages that compile to JavaScript, such as CoffeeScript, Elm, and ClojureScript. You have to write JavaScript.
* You have to use [React](https://reactjs.org) for rendering views.
* In this repository, there is a file called [documentation.md](https://github.com/evalcrew/juraland-a9faaef7d5/blob/master/documentation.md). When you have resolved the issue, add some documentation to this file.

## Prerequisites

In addition to the technologies that are essential to know to finish this challenge (like JavaScript), you have to be at least a little familiar with Git and GitHub. If you haven't used them before we recommend [this Git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) and [these GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com).

## Work plan

You are of course allowed to finish this challenge in any way you find suitable, but we recommend that you employ the following work plan:

1. Read the [background story](https://github.com/evalcrew/juraland-a9faaef7d5/wiki/Background-story) in the wiki.
2. Familiarize yourself with [the issue](https://github.com/evalcrew/juraland-a9faaef7d5/issues/1) you are assigned to resolve, by reading the specification.
3. Familiarize yourself with the [Juraland API](https://github.com/evalcrew/juraland-a9faaef7d5/wiki/Juraland-API).
4. Work on your solution to the issue.
5. Add some documentation on how to run and use the application to the [documentation.md](https://github.com/evalcrew/juraland-a9faaef7d5/blob/master/documentation.md) file.
6. Hand in your result by committing your code to the `master` branch and notify us. Read more about this below.

## Handing in your result

As you finish the issue, the code that we will evalulate should be in the `master` branch. You are free to use as many or as few branches as you want, but the `master` branch is the only branch we will evaluate.

When you have pushed your solution to the issue to the `master` branch, you notify us by sending an email to support@evalcrew.com. We will then start the assessment.

Just as with branches, you can do as many or as few commits as you want. However, we will ignore any commits that you push after you have "handed in your result" by notifying us.

## A few tips

We hope that you are eager to get started, but before you start we would like to give you a few tips.

* Read the specifications carefully.
* Think about the decisions you make during the test. You should be able to motivate the trade-offs that you make.
* Stick with libraries and tools that you feel comfortable with. This is not the right time to experiment.
* Don't forget to write tests.
* Relax and have fun!
